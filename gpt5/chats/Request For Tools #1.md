Short answer
Yes—this migration surfaced a few friction points that we can turn into tools. The big ones were: Python 3.13 native wheel pain, missing broker, missing root health route, and manual wiring between API and frontend. Below are concrete tools/improvements I’d add so the next iteration is faster and less surprising.
Tools I wish I had during this migration
Broker-aware doctor
What: A doctor that not only checks Python/Node, but also RabbitMQ availability and credentials, and validates Celery connectivity (can publish/consume a test message).
Why: The worker retry loop is noisy; discovering “broker is down” should be instant.
How: In devtools doctor, add checks for port 5672, management UI at 15672 (if present), and a tiny AMQP probe. Offer remediation help (spin up dockerized RabbitMQ if Docker is available).
“Preflight” tailored for this repo
What: One command to run:
Python: venv + requirements-dev, pytest.
Node: npm install, type-check, optional Next build.
API: health probe against / and /docs.
Broker: optional RabbitMQ up via Docker, then Celery ping.
API smoke: POST /process (mock URL), GET /tasks/{id}, GET/PUT show_notes.
Why: CI-like gating locally; catches drift in one place.
How: Add a preflight preset in devtools that chains the above; non-blocking broker step if run with eager mode.
Eager-mode switch for Celery in app code
What: Respect an env var (e.g., CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER=true) outside of tests so devs can iterate with no broker.
Why: I used eager only in tests; it’s handy for local API smoke runs.
How: In tasks.py read env; if true, set app.conf.task_always_eager = True; document in README.
API types generator for the frontend
What: Generate a typed client and interfaces from FastAPI’s OpenAPI (openapi-typescript or zod client).
Why: Avoids drift between backend responses and frontend types; speeds refactors.
How: Add a devtools subcommand or npm script that fetches /openapi.json and emits types to frontend/lib/api-types.d.ts; optionally include a thin fetch client.
Dependency strategy helper
What: A “deps doctor” that checks Python version and recommends the right path:
Dev path: requirements-dev.txt on Py 3.13 (fast, no heavy builds).
Full runtime: recommend Py 3.11/3.12 or Docker for native wheels; warns on known-problematic combinations.
Why: The Py 3.13 wheels (fastavro, frozenlist, Levenshtein, pydantic-core) cost time; we fixed by adding dev requirements, but a tool could steer devs up front.
How: Extend doctor to inspect Python version, compare to a policy, and print prescriptive steps (or launch a containerized environment).
Compose up/down
What: docker-compose that starts rabbitmq + api + worker (+ optional frontend) with sensible defaults.
Why: One-command local stack, no broker noise, consistent ports.
How: Add compose and a devtools wrapper (dev compose up/down/logs). Keep it optional; not everyone wants Docker.
E2E frontend smoke
What: A small Playwright or Cypress smoke suite: loads /, switches tabs, navigates to /edit/[name], exercises show notes update against a running API (or a mocked API).
Why: High confidence without manual clicking; catches integration gaps.
How: Scaffold in devtools e2e; allow running against NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL and skip when unavailable.
“Health scaffolding” defaults
What: Standardize root health routes and a /health endpoint with broker status (optional) and build info.
Why: Saves time vs. chasing 404s; quick status for dashboards.
How: API ships with / and /health (we added / already); consider adding a broker probe toggle.
Repo tasks runner
What: Makefile/justfile with:
make dev: start API, worker, frontend (concurrently) or compose up.
make test: pytest + type-check.
make preflight: run the repo-specific preflight.
Why: Reduce command memorization; discoverability for new contributors.
VCR scaffolding for integration tests
What: A devtools “repro scaffold” that sets up a VCR-enabled test skeleton targeting an API call.
Why: The project uses VCR for HTTP calls; makes it trivial to record once and avoid flaky external deps.
How: Generate test with cassette harness and a helper to sanitize secrets.
How this makes me faster next time
I’ll run preflight and fix what it flags, instead of iterating on missing broker/native wheels manually.
If I don’t want to run a broker: flip eager mode and still have a green workflow.
The frontend gets types generated from OpenAPI—no guessing payload shapes; refactors don’t break the UI.
Compose makes starting the whole stack a one-liner, which helps with demonstrations and onboarding.
E2E smoke gives confidence in the user flow (create → tasks → edit) without clicking through.
If you want, I can implement the top three right away: eager mode switch, repo-specific preflight, and RabbitMQ-aware doctor checks—then follow with OpenAPI type generation and compose.
