> Please implement the @tools/ you requested for previously so that we can try the migration again. This is the message 
  you had sent me: > Great. That worked well. Did you use any specific tools? Based on the failures you've had, what tools
   did you wish you 
    had to be more effective in the future?

  ⏺ Looking back at this migration task, I used the built-in tools effectively, but there were definitely moments where
    specialized tools would have made me more efficient:

    Tools I Used Successfully:

    - Read/Write/Edit: Core file manipulation
    - TodoWrite: Critical for tracking the complex multi-step migration
    - Bash: For creating directory structures and running commands
    - Grep/Glob: For exploring the codebase structure

    Tools I Wish I Had:

    1. Dependency Analyzer Tool

    When I missed the werkzeug import, a tool that could analyze Python imports and cross-reference with requirements.txt
    would have caught this immediately. Something like:
    analyze_dependencies(
        source_files="backend/**/*.py",
        requirements_file="backend/requirements.txt"
    ) -> List[MissingDependency]

    2. Docker Compose Validator

    The localhost vs service name issue is a common Docker networking mistake. A tool that could validate 
  docker-compose.yml
     configurations and detect cross-service communication issues would be invaluable:
    validate_docker_compose(
        file="docker-compose.yml",
        check_networking=True,
        check_env_vars=True
    ) -> List[ConfigurationIssue]

    3. Code Migration Assistant

    A tool specifically for framework migrations that could:
    - Map Flask routes to FastAPI endpoints
    - Convert Flask request handling to FastAPI patterns
    - Identify framework-specific patterns that need translation

    4. Integration Test Runner

    While I wrote tests, I couldn't actually run them to verify the implementation. A sandboxed test execution environment
    would help catch issues before the user runs into them.

    5. Port/Service Connectivity Checker

    A tool to verify service connectivity in different environments (local vs Docker) could have immediately identified 
  the
    networking issue:
    check_service_connectivity(
        from_service="frontend",
        to_service="backend",
        port=8000,
        environment="docker"
    ) -> ConnectivityReport

    Key Lessons:

    1. Always verify dependencies - I should have grepped for all imports before finalizing requirements.txt
    2. Consider the runtime environment - The Docker networking issue was predictable if I'd thought about container
    isolation
    3. Test incrementally - Having the ability to run tests would have caught issues earlier
    4. Use the Task tool for complex analysis - For future similar tasks, I might use the Task tool with the 
  general-purpose
     agent to do more thorough dependency analysis

    The migration was successful, but these specialized tools would have made it faster and with fewer iterations to fix
    issues.

⏺ I've successfully implemented all 5 tools you requested based on the migration challenges we encountered:

  1. dependency_analyzer.py

  Analyzes Python imports vs requirements to catch missing dependencies like the werkzeug issue. Features:
  - Scans all Python files for imports
  - Cross-references with requirements.txt and other dependency files
  - Identifies missing, unused, and conflicting dependencies
  - Provides detailed reports and fix suggestions

  2. docker_compose_validator.py

  Validates Docker Compose configurations to catch issues like the localhost vs service name problem. Features:
  - Checks for localhost references in service configurations
  - Validates networking setup between services
  - Security audit (privileged mode, capabilities, secrets)
  - Resource limits validation
  - Best practices enforcement

  3. code_migration_assistant.py

  Helps with framework migrations (initially Flask to FastAPI). Features:
  - Analyzes code patterns that need migration
  - Provides automated transformations where possible
  - Generates detailed migration plans
  - Handles imports, routes, request/response patterns
  - Extensible to other framework pairs

  4. integration_test_runner.py

  Provides sandboxed test execution with proper isolation. Features:
  - Creates isolated virtual environments
  - Docker service orchestration for tests
  - Resource monitoring (CPU, memory)
  - Parallel test execution
  - Comprehensive test reports

  5. service_connectivity_checker.py

  Verifies service connectivity across different environments. Features:
  - TCP/HTTP/HTTPS connectivity checks
  - Works across local, Docker, and Kubernetes environments
  - Connectivity matrix generation
  - Network diagnostics (DNS, routing, firewall)
  - Detailed error reporting

  Each tool includes:
  - Comprehensive CLI interface with examples
  - JSON output support for automation
  - Detailed error messages and suggestions
  - Exit codes for CI/CD integration

  These tools would have made the Flask-to-FastAPI migration much smoother by catching the dependency and networking
  issues early in the process.
