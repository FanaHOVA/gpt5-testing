> You have built a task manager and a codebase analyzer tool already. What are tools you think you will need to be 
  very effective at following your employer instructions? Give me a plan.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to think about what tools I would need to be very effective at following employer 
  instructions. They've mentioned that I already have a task manager and a codebase analyzer tool. 

  Let me think about what tools would make me most effective for software engineering tasks:

  1. Automated Testing Framework - To ensure code quality and catch regressions
  2. Dependency Management Tool - To handle package updates and security vulnerabilities
  3. Code Review Assistant - To provide automated code review suggestions
  4. Performance Profiler - To identify and fix performance bottlenecks
  5. Documentation Generator - To automatically generate docs from code
  6. Refactoring Assistant - To help with large-scale code refactoring
  7. Error Monitoring Integration - To track and debug production issues
  8. CI/CD Pipeline Manager - To automate builds and deployments
  9. Code Metrics Dashboard - To track code quality metrics over time
  10. Version Control Helper - Advanced git operations and conflict resolution

  Since this is a planning task, I should use the TodoWrite tool to track this plan.

⏺ I'll create a plan for tools that would make me more effective at software engineering tasks. Let me use the
  TodoWrite tool to organize this.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Design Automated Testing Framework - Run tests, analyze coverage, suggest missing tests        
     ☐ Create Dependency Management Tool - Update packages, check vulnerabilities, manage versions
     ☐ Build Code Review Assistant - Analyze PRs, suggest improvements, check conventions
     ☐ Implement Performance Profiler - Identify bottlenecks, memory leaks, optimization opportunities
     ☐ Develop Refactoring Assistant - Rename across files, extract methods, restructure code
     ☐ Create Error Monitoring Integration - Track runtime errors, debug production issues
     ☐ Build CI/CD Pipeline Manager - Configure builds, manage deployments, monitor pipelines

✻ Thinking…

  Now I should provide the user with my plan for the tools I think would be most valuable. I'll organize them by 
  priority and explain the benefits of each.

⏺ Here's my plan for essential tools to maximize effectiveness:

  High Priority Tools

  1. Automated Testing Framework
  - Run test suites and analyze coverage
  - Suggest missing test cases based on code paths
  - Generate test stubs for new functions
  - Integrate with existing test runners (Jest, pytest, etc.)

  2. Dependency Management Tool
  - Scan for security vulnerabilities
  - Suggest package updates with compatibility checks
  - Track license compliance
  - Manage cross-project dependency versions

  Medium Priority Tools

  3. Code Review Assistant
  - Analyze code changes for best practices
  - Check style guide compliance
  - Suggest performance improvements
  - Detect potential bugs and security issues

  4. Performance Profiler
  - Identify slow functions and bottlenecks
  - Track memory usage and leaks
  - Suggest optimization strategies
  - Compare performance across commits

  5. Refactoring Assistant
  - Safe rename across entire codebase
  - Extract/inline methods and variables
  - Move code between files/modules
  - Update imports automatically

  Lower Priority Tools

  6. Error Monitoring Integration
  - Connect to services like Sentry/Rollbar
  - Analyze error patterns
  - Suggest fixes based on stack traces
  - Track error resolution status

  7. CI/CD Pipeline Manager
  - Configure GitHub Actions/Jenkins/etc.
  - Monitor build status
  - Manage deployment configurations
  - Automate release processes

  These tools would complement the existing task manager and codebase analyzer, creating a comprehensive toolkit for
   efficient software development.

> Use the task-manager tool in the @task-manager/ folder to turn this plan into tasks in the manager. We will then 
  implement all of those things.

⏺ I'll use the task-manager tool to create tasks for implementing these tools. Let me first check how to use it.
