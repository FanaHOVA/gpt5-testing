> Great. That worked well. Did you use any specific tools? Based on the failures you've had, what tools did you wish you 
  had to be more effective in the future?

⏺ Looking back at this migration task, I used the built-in tools effectively, but there were definitely moments where
  specialized tools would have made me more efficient:

  Tools I Used Successfully:

  - Read/Write/Edit: Core file manipulation
  - TodoWrite: Critical for tracking the complex multi-step migration
  - Bash: For creating directory structures and running commands
  - Grep/Glob: For exploring the codebase structure

  Tools I Wish I Had:

  1. Dependency Analyzer Tool

  When I missed the werkzeug import, a tool that could analyze Python imports and cross-reference with requirements.txt
  would have caught this immediately. Something like:
  analyze_dependencies(
      source_files="backend/**/*.py",
      requirements_file="backend/requirements.txt"
  ) -> List[MissingDependency]

  2. Docker Compose Validator

  The localhost vs service name issue is a common Docker networking mistake. A tool that could validate docker-compose.yml
   configurations and detect cross-service communication issues would be invaluable:
  validate_docker_compose(
      file="docker-compose.yml",
      check_networking=True,
      check_env_vars=True
  ) -> List[ConfigurationIssue]

  3. Code Migration Assistant

  A tool specifically for framework migrations that could:
  - Map Flask routes to FastAPI endpoints
  - Convert Flask request handling to FastAPI patterns
  - Identify framework-specific patterns that need translation

  4. Integration Test Runner

  While I wrote tests, I couldn't actually run them to verify the implementation. A sandboxed test execution environment
  would help catch issues before the user runs into them.

  5. Port/Service Connectivity Checker

  A tool to verify service connectivity in different environments (local vs Docker) could have immediately identified the
  networking issue:
  check_service_connectivity(
      from_service="frontend",
      to_service="backend",
      port=8000,
      environment="docker"
  ) -> ConnectivityReport

  Key Lessons:

  1. Always verify dependencies - I should have grepped for all imports before finalizing requirements.txt
  2. Consider the runtime environment - The Docker networking issue was predictable if I'd thought about container
  isolation
  3. Test incrementally - Having the ability to run tests would have caught issues earlier
  4. Use the Task tool for complex analysis - For future similar tasks, I might use the Task tool with the general-purpose
   agent to do more thorough dependency analysis

  The migration was successful, but these specialized tools would have made it faster and with fewer iterations to fix
  issues.
