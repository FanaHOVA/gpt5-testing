 Tips for getting started:

 1. Ask Claude to create a new app or clone a repository
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

> Task: Create a task manager to make yourself more effective at parallelism

  Description: 

  You are an AI Engineer agent with the ability to spin up many instances of yourself in parallel. This allows you to tackle a lot of tasks at once, but
   also creates some delegation issues. All the different instances are usually in separate git worktrees and cannot see eachother's work.

  To make yourself more productive, you should create a new local tool that allows you and your instances to be in sync. This tool will only be accessed
   by yourself through cli, so make sure it ergonomically fits that use case. It should feel like a unix utility.

  Think through what interfaces it would need, possible failure modes, and the way your agents will interact with it. Some use cases to keep in mind:

  You have a new task to work on, and want to create subtasks to hand off. Some of those subtasks might depend on eachother, and you want to make sure 
  the agent who is blocked doesn't attempt to start until the other one is completed.

  While doing a task, you notice there could be an improvement to be done in the codebase but it is out of scope for your current changes. You do want 
  to make a note of it for the future though. It should be easy for you to add the task and reference what file it referred to. 

  Whenever a task is done, the tracker should be updated. Also, all other outstanding tasks should be reviewed in case the new changes impact those in 
  some way. For example one task might be looking to add a feature to an endpoint, but a task that just finished has now removed that endpoint. The 
  agent working on that task should be notified in some way.

  Also keep in mind the usual needs of tasks management like assignee, status, etc. 

  Create a folder called task-manager in this folder and do all of your work inside of it.

✻ Thinking…

  Let me break down what the user is asking for:

  1. They want me to create a task manager that can be used by multiple AI agent instances working in parallel
  2. These instances work in separate git worktrees and can't see each other's work
  3. The tool should be accessed via CLI like a unix utility
  4. Key features needed:
    - Create tasks and subtasks with dependencies
    - Track task status and assignee
    - Handle notifications when tasks complete that might affect other tasks
    - Allow adding notes about future improvements with file references
    - Review all outstanding tasks when one completes to check for impacts

  This is a fairly complex task that will require:
  - A persistent storage mechanism (probably JSON or SQLite)
  - A CLI interface
  - Task dependency tracking
  - Status tracking
  - Notification system
  - File reference tracking

  Let me start by creating the task-manager folder and planning out the architecture.

⏺ I'll create a task manager tool designed for AI agents working in parallel across different git worktrees. Let me start by planning and implementing
  this system.

  Now let me update the todo list - I've completed several tasks already.

     # Task Manager for Parallel AI Agents
     A Unix-style CLI tool designed for AI agents working in parallel across different git worktrees. This tool provides synchronized task management
     with dependency tracking, notifications, and impact analysis.
     ## Features
     - **Parallel Agent Support**: Tasks are stored in a shared location accessible across all git worktrees
     - **Dependency Management**: Tasks can depend on other tasks and are automatically blocked/unblocked
     - **File Reference Tracking**: Track which files are related to each task
     - **Impact Analysis**: When tasks complete, analyze potential impacts on other tasks

  Now let me update the todo list and create some test scenarios to demonstrate the tool.

  Let me make the demo script executable and create one more file - a setup script for easy installation.

  Great! Let me test listing tasks.

⏺ Bash(cd task-manager && ./tm list -v)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):cd:1: no such file or directory: task-manager

✻ Thinking…

  Let me fix the command - I need to use the correct path.

⏺ Bash(./task-manager/tm list -v)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):1: no such file or directory: ./task-manager/tm

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check the current directory and path.

⏺ Bash(pwd && ls -la task-manager/)
  ⎿  Error: ls: task-manager/: No such file or directory

     /Users/alessiofanelli/self-improving/opus4/task-manager

✻ Thinking…

  Ah, I see - I'm already in the task-manager directory. Let me test directly.

⏺ Bash(./tm list -v)

  The files look good and are all related to the task manager implementation. Let me clean up the test task data before finishing.

⏺ Bash(rm -rf ~/.task-manager)
  ⎿  (No content)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive task manager for AI agents working in parallel. Let me summarize what was built.

⏺ Task Manager Created Successfully!

  I've built a Unix-style CLI task manager in the task-manager folder with the following features:

  Core Features

  - Parallel Agent Support: Tasks stored in ~/.task-manager/ accessible across all git worktrees
  - Dependency Tracking: Tasks automatically block/unblock based on dependencies
  - File References: Track which files are associated with tasks
  - Impact Analysis: Warns when completed tasks affect other tasks' referenced files
  - Notification System: Agents get notified when their blocked tasks become available
  - Unix-style CLI: Clean, ergonomic command interface

  Key Commands

  tm add "Task title" -p high -f file.py          # Add task
  tm list -v                                       # List all tasks  
  tm start 1                                       # Begin work
  tm complete 1                                    # Mark done
  tm notifications                                 # Check alerts

  Files Created

  - tm - Main executable (Python script)
  - README.md - Comprehensive documentation
  - QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Command cheat sheet
  - demo.sh - Interactive demonstration
  - setup.sh - Installation helper

  The tool uses color-coded output, priority symbols, and tracks task relationships to help coordinate work across parallel agent instances.
