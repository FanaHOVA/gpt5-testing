**User**

You have built a task manager and a codebase analyzer tool already. What are tools you think you will need to be very effective at following your employer instructions? Give me a plan. 

---

**Cursor**

I'll analyze the existing tools and create a comprehensive plan for additional tools that would enhance effectiveness in following employer instructions. Let me first understand what's already available.

Based on my analysis of the existing tools and common development workflows, here's a comprehensive plan for additional tools that would make me highly effective at following employer instructions:

## Strategic Tool Development Plan

### 1. **Requirements Parser & Clarifier**
**Purpose**: Automatically analyze employer instructions to extract clear, actionable requirements

**Key Features**:
- Natural language parsing to identify:
  - Technical requirements vs business requirements
  - Explicit tasks vs implicit expectations
  - Success criteria and acceptance tests
- Ambiguity detection with automatic clarification questions
- Requirement decomposition into subtasks
- Integration with existing task manager

**Implementation**:
```python
# Example usage
$ rp parse "Add authentication to the API with OAuth2, make sure it's secure"
# Output:
# Technical Requirements:
# - Implement OAuth2 authentication
# - Add to existing API endpoints
# 
# Implicit Requirements:
# - Security best practices
# - Token storage and rotation
# - Rate limiting
# 
# Clarification Needed:
# - Which OAuth2 flow? (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, etc.)
# - Which providers to support?
# - Session duration requirements?
```

### 2. **Context Awareness System**
**Purpose**: Maintain deep understanding of project state and history

**Key Features**:
- Automatic project documentation scanning
- Git history analysis for pattern detection
- Dependency mapping and impact analysis
- "Project Memory" - remembers past decisions and patterns
- Integration with codebase analyzer

**Components**:
- **Project Scanner**: Indexes all documentation, READMEs, comments
- **Decision Logger**: Tracks architectural decisions and rationale
- **Pattern Recognizer**: Identifies coding patterns specific to the project

### 3. **Automated Workflow Orchestrator**
**Purpose**: Execute complex multi-step workflows automatically

**Key Features**:
- Workflow templates for common tasks (e.g., "add new endpoint", "refactor module")
- Automatic environment setup and teardown
- Parallel execution of independent steps
- Rollback capabilities
- Progress monitoring and reporting

**Example Workflows**:
```yaml
# workflow: add-api-endpoint.yaml
name: Add REST API Endpoint
steps:
  - validate_requirements:
      check: ["method", "path", "auth_required", "request_schema", "response_schema"]
  - generate_code:
      templates: ["controller", "service", "tests", "documentation"]
  - update_routing:
      auto: true
  - create_tests:
      types: ["unit", "integration", "e2e"]
  - update_documentation:
      files: ["API.md", "openapi.yaml"]
```

### 4. **Smart Test Generator**
**Purpose**: Automatically create comprehensive test suites based on code changes

**Key Features**:
- Analyzes code to generate relevant test cases
- Edge case detection and generation
- Test data generation with realistic values
- Coverage gap analysis
- Integration with existing test frameworks
- Mutation testing support

### 5. **Communication Bridge**
**Purpose**: Facilitate clear communication about progress and blockers

**Key Features**:
- Automatic status report generation
- Blocker detection and escalation
- Question aggregation (batch clarifications)
- Visual progress dashboards
- Integration with task manager for real-time updates

**Output Example**:
```markdown

**User**

Use the task-manager tool in the @task-manager/  folder to turn this plan into tasks in the manager. We will then implement all of those things.

---

**Cursor**

I'll use the task manager to create tasks for implementing all the tools in the development plan. Let me start by understanding the task manager structure and then create a comprehensive task list.

Let me first ensure the task manager is properly set up and then create tasks for our tool development plan.

Now I'll create all the tasks for our tool development plan. Let me start with the main project task and then break it down into phases and individual tools.

Now let me add some subtasks for the critical tools to provide more detailed implementation guidance. I'll start with the Requirements Parser:

Let me view the task structure we've created:

Let me create a summary report of all the tasks we've created:
